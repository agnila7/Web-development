              Graduated with honors in a thesis-based Master of
              Applied Science program from the University of Windsor in the
              Department of Electrical &amp; Computer Engineering. My primary
              research was focused on energy efficient Next Generation
              Wireless Communication. I developed an energy-efficient model designed 
              on Layer 1 in OFDM with Index Modulation. I also obtained Amazon web service Cloud Practitioner
              certificate to learn Cloud Computing. Currently, I am doing Springboot Projects while accumulating
              knowledge in Java, OOP, Spring, HTML/CSS, and Javascript. I like reading books, traveling, and dancing.
              I hate to cook but love to eat different cuisines. 
              This is my blog where I preserve my daily findings, interests,  life learnt lessons, activities and records of my life. I hope someday, a new immigrant can get help from this.

                I recently came across an amazing book named "The Almanack of Namav Ravikant". I follow a Bangladeshi Vlogger, Khadizatul Kobra Sonya on Facebook. She suggests books on all different perspectives of life. I personally like the books on personal, social, and financial growth. I also love her feedback on fictional books similar to "Before Your Memory Fades". My recent goal is to become a financially independent woman. I loved reading the book of Naval Ravikant suggested by Soniya. <br>
                1. In this book, he taught that Creating wealth is not evil but lusting for money is evil. Wealth and Money have different definitions. Wealth is assets that you earn even while you sleep. Money is the social credit, it is how we transfer wealth. Money can credit or debit other's time. Paying in return for one's time is not going to make us rich. <br>
                2. Find your compound interest, this is the work that will be a play for you but work for others. Hence, you can invest 16 hours a day but others can not do as they see it as work. <br>
                3. Use wealth to buy your freedom. If you increase your lifestyle according to your wealth, you can't retire. Retirement is when you stop sacrificing today for an imaginary tomorrow. When today is complete, in and of itself, you're retired. So, keep your lifestyle moderate or create enough wealth to get the freedom to do anything. <br>
                4. Give a price tag on your hourly value. keep an insane hourly rate and outsource all the work you feel is beyond your rate. Do not compromise on personal fitness or family matters. Work accordingly to keep your value. <br>
                5. I am still reading on Happiness chapter. I hope that I will find more interesting topics on that.

                My toddler is 3 years old. Spending time with her is really fun for 1 hour. As a parent, we all have one goal to keep them busy with activities. So, they are not addicted to screen time (TV, Phone, YouTube, etc.). This is the time to grow their creativity and explore as many activities as possible.Toronto Registered Recreations Program helps to find affordable programs. They have a variety¬†of programs from swimming to skating, drawing, dancing, etc. Some of them are paid and others are free.<br>
                There is a catch. If you are a resident of that recreation area, you don't need to pay any fee. Hence, The location is graded according to the school and recreation centers they provide. Choose wisely before buying or renting a house.<br>
                As a nonresident, I needed to pay extra. since the 2nd catch arrived. 2nd catch is that you need to know the registration date and time beforehand. the programs get full within a second. So, (a) know the registration date and time before; (b) note down the barcode of each interested program, (c) know your client ID and family number, (d) know your payment method. Usually, the registration time is 7 am, and when you are ready with all this information, go straight to the program and keep clicking until you can get in.<br>
                Our relative, Leninda, advised this suggestion and it worked great. Now my toddler got into a swimming lesson.
